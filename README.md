# Sanic template

A template for Sanic-based projects. Inspired by the [Web Development with Sanic](https://sanicbook.com/) book. To run this example use this command:
```shell
sanic sanic_template.app.create --factory
```

Classes such as `Sanic` and `Request` are subclassed mainly for typehinting purposes.
